I am shuaichen Wu. A data scientist. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with an M.S. degree in Information Security. Later, however, I fell in love with Artificial Intelligence.
I enjoy problem-solving in both the real and the digital world. I'm able to be an active leader and valuable teammate.

Being a data scientist, and using skills learned before, to find patterns in this complex information world will help me mark the most efficient way to bring impact for people and business.


### More Information


I am Shuaichen, and I just graduated from the BrainStation Bootcamp as a data science student. Prior to that, I worked in Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and contractor roles.

There are two main characteristics that drive me in work and life. First is teamwork: I am good at cooperating and know how to keep the most important goals on track in a group. I know sometimes teamwork needs diverse thoughts, and I can selectively choose what I think definitely needs to be considered versus what can be dropped.

Second, I am result-oriented. I don’t make intuitive decisions, I always need to write down all of my choices, and go through them systematically. If in some situations I can’t go through each one, then I will make sure to go through all the similar cases and consult the right expertise to narrow down my choices.

Now, a little bit about my background: my undergraduate major is Computer Science with a double major in Internet Communication. Then I received my Master's degree from Johns Hopkins University in Information Security. 

I would be ecstatic to be considered for this position. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me via my phone number, email, or any of my other provided contact information.
