I am Shuaichen.

I just graduated from the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp in April, 2022.

During my master program in Johns Hopkins University, I fell in love with Artificial Intelligence. I Began to build my skilss in data area. I wrote my first independent data science project -- Machine Learning Based Spam Email Detection.

Being a data scientist, and using skills learned before, to find patterns in this complex information world will help me mark the most efficient way to bring impact for people and business.


### More Information

There are two main characteristics that drive me in work and life. First is teamwork: I am good at cooperating and know how to keep the most important goals on track in a group. I know sometimes teamwork needs diverse thoughts, and I can selectively choose what I think definitely needs to be considered versus what can be dropped.

Second, I am result-oriented. I don’t make intuitive decisions, I always need to write down all of my choices, and go through them systematically. If in some situations I can’t go through each one, then I will make sure to go through all the similar cases and consult the right expertise to narrow down my choices.

Now, a little bit about my background: my undergraduate major is Computer Science with a double major in Internet Communication. Then I received my Master's degree from Johns Hopkins University in Information Security.
